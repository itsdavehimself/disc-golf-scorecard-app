# ChainSeeker app

## Project Description

ChainSeeker is my first ever full-stack web development project, dedicated to creating a utility app tailored for disc golf enthusiasts. As an avid disc golfer myself, I developed this application to meet the unique needs of the disc golf community.

### Key Features:

- **Score Tracking System:** Effortlessly record and monitor your disc golf rounds.

- **Create Friend Profiles:** You can create friend profiles inside the app so that you can play together and keep track of everyone's scores.

- **Performance Statistics:** Track and review your performance and see how well you are doing against your friends.

- **Mobile-First Design:** This project was created using a mobile-first approach as the app lends itself to be used typically on the fairway.

- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy the app seamlessly on various devices, making it your go-to companion during disc golf adventures.

- **Technological Showcase:** ChainSeeker showcases my proficiency in full-stack development, incorporating express, nodeJS, Vite, React, Lottie, MongoDB, and Mongo Atlas.

This project is more than just a showcase of my skills; it's a passion project born out of my love for disc golf. ChainSeeker was crafted with the goal of enhancing the disc golf experience, initially for my personal use and that of a few friends. See you on the fairway!
